# Schizophrenia EEG-based classification with Machine Learning

This is a personal project that explores the classification of schizophrenia patients using EEG data through machine learning techniques.

## Description
I used the publicly avaialble ASZED dataset, which contains EEG recordings from both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, with the goal to build models capable of distinguishing between these groups based on their brain activity patterns. To carry this out, I did the following:

* Studied research papers relevant to the disorder, as well as the fundamentals of EEGs, and how they are used to support the diagnosis of the disorder
* Preprocessed the data I obtained the way I saw fit, based on the previous step
* Extracted the most relevant features from the EEG recordings
* Trained and evaluated multiple ML classifiers
* Calculated performance metrics and visualized the results

## Content
In this repository, you may find all the relevant coding files.
I have also included an extensive project report where I explain the process in detail.
